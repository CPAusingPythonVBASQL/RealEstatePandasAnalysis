# RealEstatePandasAnalysis
Class based implementation to quickly analyze Redfin real estate listings against Zillow market data

Sample use is maintained in:
(1) RealEstateAnalyzeDataGenerate.py -- sample use for initial load of the data. Before utilizing the data load class you will first need to generate the data.
(2) RealEstateAnalyze.py -- sample use after the initial data is loaded. These classess are utilized to return pandas dataframes objects from the previously loaded data.
(3) CSVDownload Folder -- this contains the loaded data from Redfin/Zillow. I also load working outputs within the same folder, but they do not have to be maintained there.
